# Introduction

Recently I rediscovered
[Geocaching](https://www/geocaching.com/)
as a hobby. It is a nice reason to walk around in a city or in
nature and discover interessting facts and have a nice time in general.

When searching for clues for a `Mystery cache`, I needed to calculate
a destination from a starting point, bearing and distance.

With my nautical background, this used to be a regular operation for me.
I prefer to use Python scripts for calculations like this
so the process is repeatable.

So I started coding this package.

## Formulas

I don't know which formulas
[GeoCaching Toolbox](https://www.geocachingtoolbox.com/)
uses, but I couldn't reproduce the results.

I used the formulas on
[Movable Type Scripts](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html).
Those I recognized from my studies at a Nautical Collage.

## Project name

`bstb` or `breastbone` is a random generated project name and has no special meaning.
